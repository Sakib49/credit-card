# 5 Other Non Functional Requirements



## 5.1 Performance Requirements

Performance requirements depend on the machine learning model use. Right now as the database is small we are using content based recommendations for bangladeshi credit cards, but most likely a collaborative filtering model will be used for better performance after getting more users. Since it depends heavily on the implementation performance requirement details will be fixed later.

## 5.2 Safety Requirements

Not Applicable as the system only shows recommendations for financial products.

## 5.3 Security Requirements

Not applicable as the system does not store much confidential data about the user such as credit card information.

## 5.4 Software Quality Attributes 

Software should be fast with an intuitive user interface for financially less-literate users.

## 5.5 Business Rules

Not applicable as the recommendation system is not doing any explicit business with any bank at this moment.

# Appendix B : A selection of potential credit cards being considered for recommendation.
